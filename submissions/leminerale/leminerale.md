### Introduce Yourself
I am deeply passionate about building decentralized applications (dApps) across various blockchain ecosystems within the Web3 space. Currently, I work as a freelance Node Developer, specializing in running and operating nodes, as well as contributing to the infrastructure of decentralized networks. My enthusiasm for blockchain technology drives me to continuously explore and innovate in this ever-evolving field.
